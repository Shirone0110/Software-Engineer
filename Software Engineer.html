		<br />
		People running to computer science class, kids want to become software developers, programmers,
		... The reason is the work chances available, the money they can make, and maybe also make their parents proud. People come to computer science with the eager-to-learn, passion. 
		They want to make changes to the world with their creations, products. Whatever your reason is, there are things you need to know to become a successful software engineer.

		<h2>Things you should know to become a successful software engineer</h2>
		<p><i>These ideas are based on video <cite>Software Enginner: Reality vs Expectations 3</cite> from Youtube Channel <b>ENGINEERED TRUTH</b>:

		<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
		<img src="Collaboration.png" alt="Collaboration" width="679" height="410"/> <br />

		<br />
		Unlike many people think, software engineers don't work seperately. They collaborate, they talk and discuss. While developing a new function, or creating a new app, it is 
		necessary, maybe even obligatory for everyone to exchange ideas, help each other figure things out. Many brains are better than a brain. Besides, the ability to cooperate
		is what many companies or graduate schools are looking for in an application. With that being said, our class has many activities that would help develop our ability to work as a 
		team, such as lab work in pairs, peer assessed.

		<h3 id="soft_skills">Soft skills</h3>
		<img src="Soft skills.png" alt="Soft skills" width="780" height="528"/> <br />
		<p>
		Source: <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/soft-skills">What is soft skills?</a><br />
		<br />
		The second truth that Mayuko mentioned in the video is that <q>Soft skills are as important, or maybe more important than technical skills.</q> <br />
		But first, what are soft skills? <br />
		<blockquote cite="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-are-soft-skills-2060852">
		Soft skills are the personal attributes, personality traits, inherent social cues, and communication abilities needed for success on the job. Soft skills characterize how a person
		interacts in his or her relationships with others. Soft skills include adaptability, attitude, communication, teamwork, time management,...
		</blockquote>
		So the problem is, not just you have to be good at your field of study, but you also have to be a nice person, know how to finish your work on time, treat others in the right 
		way.<br />
		In our class, we will have the opportunity to communicate with other people to solve a problem together, which will make us <q>a better communicator</q>. And having to submit
		our work on time is the chance for us to polish our time-management skill. Being prepared, engage in class,... these are things that we need to develop better soft skills.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="be_yourself">Be yourself</h3>
		<img src="Be yourself.png" alt="Be yourself" width="375" height="450"/> <br />
		<p>
		Source: <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/irenekohstudio/works/31539768-kawaii-potato-always-be-yourself?p=photographic-print">Be yourself</a> <br />
		<br />
		The next thing we need to know is being yourself and being a successful engineer can go together. <br />
		Not all engineers wear glasses. Not all engineers wear hoodie and jeans to work. Not all engineers start programming since junior high school. <br />
		Everyone has their own style, and work at their own pace. You're not a billionare at 30? No problem. You only begin coding in college? Still no problem. You don't pass this class?
		Unfortunately yes, it's a problem. <br />
		It's okay to be yourself and do what you want, but not in a negative way of course. <br />
		There are many and many more people join the engineering community. Find yourself a role model that has the same background as you, like if you're an Asian girl you can take 
		Mayuko as your model. Everything's easier when you know you're not alone.
		Yet, you can express yourself in class by adding your own features into your website, or stuff like that.

		<h3 id="empathy">Empathy</h3>
		<img src="Empathy.jpg" alt="Empathy" width="562" height="428"/> <br />
		<p>
		Source: <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/echoes/empathy-looking-others-through-their-eyes-1554670">Looking at others through their eyes</a> <br />
		<br />
		Alfred Adler, an Australian medical doctor and psychotherapist said:
		<blockquote cite="http://www.inspiremykids.com/2016/great-empathy-quotes-kids-students-children/">
		"Empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another and feeling with the heart of another."
		</blockquote>
		Like we mentioned in the previous part, everyone has their own pace. A task can be easy for you, but others can feel difficulty doing it. If you choose to laugh at them and say
		things like that's the easiest problem I've ever seen and you still can't do it, that means you have no empathy. Empathy is a soft skill that need so much time and patience to
		master. Here in this class, you can practice it through reading others' code. Understand why they write it, not judging them like <q>Ew this is so awful</q>. 
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="more_things">Additional things that I find important</h3>
		<p>
		So, above are elements from the video and syllabus. A couple more things that I think is also important:<br />
		<ol>
			<li>Always stay up-to-date. Technology always changing. 40 years ago people can't never imagine the day when we can read our news not on newspapers anymore. Programming 
			languages also change. If you stop learning, you'll fall behind. It's easy to learn today, Youtube and Google can teach you many things.</li><br />
			<img src="Programming Languages.png" alt="Programming Languages" width="1000" height="788"/> <br />
			<br />
			<li>Debugging skills are very very very important. Don't just depend on your partner to find all your bugs. Try to do it yourself.</li><br />
			<li>Last but not least, have fun while coding! Don't push yourself too hard, the most important thing here is you.</li>
		</ol>
